# Cross-Chain Utility and Value Creation

## Timeline: 11-NOV until 23-DEC 5pm EST

## Description:
Build a tool that expands on the cross chain token bridge transfer of Bounty 1. Create a cross chain value producing transation sequence between at least 2 different blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, Binance Smart Chain, etc.) that produces value. Leveraging the Messina SDK for cross-chain transactions, you can think of Arbitrage Trading, Stablecoin Swapping, Yield Optimizing, or Token Staking. Keep in mind to account for things like protocol fees / transaction fees / price impact etc.

Be creative! 

### Requirements:
Use the Messina SDK to initiate token transfers between networks
Must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript
You could use the Messina One API or other sources like dex screener or derive it yourself directly on chain.
Execute potential buy/sell trades through any SDK of your choice e.g (Uniswap SDK or Raydium SDK etc to take advantage of price differences)
Provide an alert or reporting mechanisms to notify users of events or activities. (simply printing out a response on the command would suffice)

### Skills: JavaScript, Messina SDK, market analysis, API integration

### Considerations:
For this bounty we are looking for sample code to go into our public docs and help future developers create tooling, work with cross chain infrastructure, and build platforms.
Any creative adaptation of the above requirements can also considered as valid entries if it helps grow the developer toolkit and appeal.

## Rewards:
1. Winner 10,000 ALGO - Chosen by a Code Quest panel based on impact, creativity, quality, and complexity of the code.
2. Runner Up 5,000 ALGO - Chosen by a Code Quest panel, see "Winner"
3. Participation Rewards Pool 10,000 - Divided between all entries deemed valid
Disclaimer: A participant can only earn the participation reward once, but is allowed multiple entries to try and win the bounty.
