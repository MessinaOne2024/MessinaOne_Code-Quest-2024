# Messina: Code Quest Program

## How They Work / What Would Be Required for Developers:
## Each bounty requires developers to:
### Familiarise with Messina SDK: 
Developers must understand how to interact with the SDK to facilitate cross-chain communication and transactions.
### Automate Processes: 
The core focus of most bounties involves automating a process that either improves liquidity, optimises yield, or performs arbitrage across multiple chains.
### Interchain Communication: 
Developers should ensure that transactions across blockchains are seamless, including handling potential issues with gas fees, transaction speed, # and compatibility between chains.
### Monitor Real-Time Data: 
For many bounties (like the arbitrage bot or stablecoin swapper), By providing practical solutions to improve cross-chain interoperability, these bounty programs will not only demonstrate the power of the Messina SDK but also foster the development of innovative tools in the blockchain ecosystem.

# Post Bounty, User Incentive Mechanism: 
VALID FOR ALL BOUNTIES
## Airdrops in ALGO tokens for each transaction on the bridge that is pushed through one of the Bounty produced tools or applications. 50,000 total $ALGO allocated for this initiative.
