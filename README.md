# Messina: Code Quest Program

## How They Work / What Would Be Required for Developers:
## Each bounty requires developers to:
### Familiarise with Messina SDK: 
Developers must understand how to interact with the SDK to facilitate cross-chain communication and transactions.
### Automate Processes: 
The core focus of most bounties involves automating a process that either improves liquidity, optimises yield, or performs arbitrage across multiple chains.
### Interchain Communication: 
Developers should ensure that transactions across blockchains are seamless, including handling potential issues with gas fees, transaction speed, # and compatibility between chains.
### Monitor Real-Time Data: 
For many bounties (like the arbitrage bot or stablecoin swapper), By providing practical solutions to improve cross-chain interoperability, these bounty programs will not only demonstrate the power of the Messina SDK but also foster the development of innovative tools in the blockchain ecosystem.
### Public Good & Open Source:
All participating developers understand their valid code is open source and considered public good, and to be added to the Messina Docs as sample code to be used by fellow developers and builders.
