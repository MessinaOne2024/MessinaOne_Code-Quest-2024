# Cross-Chain Token Bridge Transfer: Bidirectional Transfers to and from Algorand Network

## Timeline: 11-NOV until 1-DEC

## Description: 
Build a JavaScript application that uses the Messina SDK to automatically bridge a token from the Algorand blockchain to another network. The application should be able to trigger the bridging process to move the token from Algorand to the other network. It should confirm the transaction on the receiving network that the token was successfully bridged aka “signedVAA” and then the bridged token should be redeemed on the other network. To confirm it was successful the token and respective balance should be shown when viewing the receiving wallet on a blockchain explorer.

# Requirements:
Use the Messina SDK to initiate token transfers from Algorand to BASE (or any other) network and vice versa.
Must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript

# Skills: JavaScript/TypeScript, Messina SDK, Web3.js, API integration

# Considerations:
For this bounty we are looking for sample code to go into our public docs and help future developers create tooling, work with cross chain infrastructure, and build platforms. Any creative adaptation of the above requirements can also considered as valid entries if it helps grow the developer toolkit and appeal. The bidirectional transfer of tokens to and from Algorand is the backbone of all other bounties as well. Therefore the rewards on this particular bounty are lower, and further development beyond mere bridging of tokens will be rewarded significantly higher.

## Rewards:
1. Winner 5,000 ALGO - Chosen by a Code Quest panel based on impact, creativity, quality, and complexity of the code.
2. Runner Up 2,500 ALGO - Chosen by a Code Quest panel, see "Winner"
3. Participation Rewards Pool 5,000 - Divided between all entries deemed valid
Disclaimer: A participant can only earn the participation reward once, but is allowed multiple entries to try and win the bounty.
