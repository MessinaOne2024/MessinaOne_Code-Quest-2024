# Cross-Chain Arbitrage Bot

## Timeline: 11-NOV until 1-DEC

## Description:
Build a bot that continuously monitors between at least 2 different blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, Binance Smart Chain, etc.) for arbitrage opportunities. The bot should be able to buy low on one chain and sell high on another chain, leveraging the Messina SDK for cross-chain transactions. Keep in mind to account for things like bridge fees / transaction fees / price impact etc

### Requirements:
Use the Messina SDK to initiate token transfers between networks
Must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript
Monitor prices across multiple chains for arbitrage opportunities. You could use the Messina One API or other sources like dex screener or derive it yourself directly on chain.
Execute buy/sell  trades through the any SDK of your choice e.g (Uniswap SDK or Rayidum SDK etc to take advantage of price differences.
Provide an alert or reporting system to notify users of profits and trade activity e.g (simply printing out a response on the command would suffice)

### Skills: JavaScript, Messina SDK, market analysis, API integration

### Considerations:
For this bounty we are looking for sample code to go into our public docs and help future developers create tooling, work with cross chain infrastructure, and build platforms.
Any creative adaptation of the above requirements can also considered as valid entries if it helps grow the developer toolkit and appeal.
